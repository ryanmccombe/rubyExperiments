# In this kata, you should calculate type of triangle with three given sides a, b and c.
# If all angles are less than 90째, this triangle is acute and function should return 1.
# If one angle is strictly 90째, this triangle is right and function should return 2.
# If one angle more than 90째, this triangle is obtuse and function should return 3.
# If three sides cannot form triangle, or one angle is 180째 (which turns triangle into segment) - function should return 0.
