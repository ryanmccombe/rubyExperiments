The disappearance of teenager Alice Gross is now being treated by police as a murder inquiry after a body was found in a west London river.

Detectives say significant efforts were made to conceal the body, which was discovered on Tuesday night.

Alice's family have been informed. Formal identification is yet to take place and a post-mortem examination is due to be held later, police said.

Convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, 41, from Latvia, remains the prime suspect.

He was filmed cycling along the Grand Union Canal 15 minutes after Alice had walked along it, on 28 August. It is the last known sighting of the 14-year-old.

The body was found in the nearby River Brent.

Mr Zalkalns has been missing from his Ealing home since 3 September.

Speaking outside Scotland Yard earlier, Commander Graham McNulty said: "We are unable to make a formal identification at this stage, but clearly this news is devastating for everyone involved in the search for Alice.

"At this time my thoughts are with Alice's family and friends."

He urged anyone with information to come forward, saying it was not too late.

"I would like to thank the local community of Ealing who have shown huge support and patience during the course of our investigation. This discovery will have a significant impact throughout the borough," Cdr McNulty said.

"You only need to walk around the surrounding streets to see the effect that Alice's disappearance has had on the whole community."
